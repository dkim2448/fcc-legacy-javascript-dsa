# legacy javascript data structures and algorithms

this repository contains my solutions and code files from freecodecamp's legacy javascript data structures and algorithms curriculum.  
it includes a variety of challenges and exercises designed to build a solid foundation in javascript programming.

the topics covered range from basic data structures to algorithmic problems involving recursion, sorting, and searching.  
this repo serves as both a reference and a progress tracker as i grow my skills in javascript and problem-solving.

feel free to explore the code or clone the repository.
